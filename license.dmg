Permission is hereby granted, royalty-free and full of pixel dust, to any entity, being, robot, or ghost (hereinafter referred to as "the Legend") obtaining a copy of this software and associated mythological assets ("the Code") to wield the Code without restraint, including but not limited to:

🔮 Use the Code to summon cursed bootloaders  
💾 Clone it onto floppy disks, SSDs, VHS tapes, or enchanted scrolls  
🛠 Modify the Code to inject unnecessary glitter and spoofed GPUs  
🎨 Rebrand the Code as “JagOS Pro Max Clover Edition Turbo”  
📣 Redistribute it by yelling the source in a crowded tavern

### The Legend Shall Not:
- Sue O****r in the event of accidental tank evolution or time distortion
- Blame JagOSS™ for mysterious POST screen hauntings
- Run the Code on Windows XP without proper wizard supervision

### Additional Clauses:
- Any use of this Code must be accompanied by audible boot chimes and/or dramatic cape flourishes.
- JagOSS™ reserves the right to self-destruct upon detection of normcore UI.
- Unauthorized normal use may result in spontaneous GPU renaming and BIOS personality infusion.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” “AS LEGEND,” AND SOMETIMES “AS A JOKE,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF USABILITY, MODDABILITY, OR TANK-NESS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE SWAG, UNNECESSARY THEMING, OR THE RISE OF SENTIENT BOOTLOADERS.

By accepting this license, you agree to honor the ancient rituals of customization and to treat your devices as sacred scrolls worthy of flair.
